## The ENTIRE display-space fold "module" — THREE statics, no object (ADR-0074, ADR-0191,
## CONTEXT.md "Fold"):
##
##   add(carrier, material, order_z, rank)  the decorator that makes a carrier foldable (no-op off-fork)
##   owns() -> bool                         is the fold available in THIS BUILD
##   shader(folded, fallback) -> Shader     the two-way pick that hangs off owns()
##
## It was one static until 2026-08-27. What it is still NOT is material construction, attach or stamp:
## ADR-0074 made the material producer-owned and the ordering DepthMode's, and ADR-0191 dec. 4 re-refused
## a factory on a measurement 0074 did not have — only 6 of the 16 compositor_layer shaders are
## mechanical, and those six are already deduplicated one layer down, into two .gdshaderinc files,
## by dec. 6 (ADR-0191 dec. 4 carries the corrected numbers). A factory would
## also have to take texture / palette_texture / palette_rows across a seam with no business
## knowing them. There is no registry either (dec. 5): a table here would hold res://
## paths into the host and add a startup ordering whose failure mode is "the effect silently vanished."
##
## Membership in the engine's held-out pass is TWO per-instance properties (compositor_layer primitive),
## not just a material — hence one call that stamps both.
##
## `add` hands any GeometryInstance3D (a single-quad MeshInstance3D, a baked multi-quad ArrayMesh, or a
## batched MultiMeshInstance3D — all GeometryInstance3D) its monomorphic `compositor_layer` material AND
## its per-instance membership: `render_layer` = the shared FOLD_LAYER resource (which held-out target)
## + `render_layer_order` = its int32 caller-order key. The engine collects every instance carrying a
## valid `render_layer` whose shader declares `compositor_layer`, and paints them in ascending
## `render_layer_order` into the engine-owned target for that layer.
##
## Ordering is DepthMode's (render_layer_order_for), not the fold's: the producer supplies its own
## representative OT ordering key (order_z, view-space Z) and its submission-stream `rank` (0 for a lone
## quad). See DepthMode.render_layer_order_for and the "Fold order" glossary entry.

## The single shared held-out layer every fold carrier joins (one resource -> one partition, the engine's
## one-partition fast path). Preloaded by path so Fold.add and EngineFoldCompositor share the SAME cached
## instance (identical ObjectID = one layer).
const FOLD_LAYER := preload("res://addons/exmateria_schema/compositing_key/fold_layer.tres")

## The ordering the fold is GIVEN rather than computes — reached by `preload`
## path, because this addon names its own internals by path and never by a
## global (ADR-0212 dec. 1).
const DepthMode = preload("res://addons/exmateria_schema/compositing_key/DepthMode.gd")


## Cached answer to owns(): -1 unqueried, 0 false, 1 true. A tri-state int rather than a bool plus a
## "queried" flag, so the unqueried state is unrepresentable as an answer. The value is a property of
## the BUILD and cannot change within a process, so one query is the whole lifetime's worth.
static var _owns_cache: int = -1


## Does this build own display-space compositing? True on a fork supporting the `compositor_layer`
## primitive under Forward+; false everywhere else, where a producer must draw its in-scene fallback.
##
## THE fold predicate (ADR-0191 dec. 1). It lived as a verbatim six-line copy at fourteen call sites,
## each reaching the CompositorAutopilot autoload by node-path string and duck-typing owns_compositing()
## on an untyped Node. It belongs to the kernel on three counts: a sibling addon asking it stops being
## a foreign-autoload reach, tests/ can ask without booting an autoload, and it names what the value
## actually is — a capability of the BUILD, not a state of the game.
##
## Feature-detect, never version-sniff: has_method guards builds predating the accessor, and
## is_compositor_layer_supported() is itself Forward+-only, so the two collapse into one honest query.
## This is the SAME query CompositorAutopilot._ready takes, and CompositorAutopilot.active is written
## in exactly one place from exactly it — so this is not merely equivalent to the retired
## owns_compositing(), it is identical in every reachable state.
static func owns() -> bool:
	if _owns_cache < 0:
		_owns_cache = 1 if (RenderingServer.has_method("is_compositor_layer_supported")
			and RenderingServer.is_compositor_layer_supported()) else 0
	return _owns_cache == 1


## Pick between a producer's two shaders on the build predicate: the `compositor_layer` twin when
## this build folds, the in-scene twin when it does not.
##
## Takes Shader OBJECTS, never paths (ADR-0191 dec. 2). A load() on a mistyped path returns null, and
## a null shader here does not raise — the fold "just stops, with no error" (tests/FoldSurfaceTest.gd
## records that hazard by name). Callers hold preloaded consts, so the same typo is a parse error.
## Keeping paths out also keeps the kernel from naming a host file, which check_addon_portability.py
## forbids outright.

const _EXIT_HOOK_META := "_fold_exit_unenroll"

## Make `carrier` foldable: wear `material` (as material_override, which wins over any surface material)
## and carry its per-instance layer membership (render_layer = FOLD_LAYER) + the fold-order key for
## (order_z, rank). Idempotent — safe to call every frame as a carrier's depth changes (only order_z
## moves; material_override / render_layer re-assign the same RID cheaply).
##
## NO-OP when this build does not own compositing (`owns()` false) — it decorates nothing at all, not
## even the material_override. ADR-0191 dec. 12; `tests/FoldTest.gd` section 5 pins it.

	# SELF-GATED OFF-FORK (ADR-0191 dec. 12). `render_layer` / `render_layer_order` are
	# FORK-ONLY properties, so the two assignments below do not quietly do nothing on a build without
	# them — they RAISE. Measured on stock 4.7.1 in a throwaway project: `mi.render_layer = null`
	# gives "Invalid assignment of property or key 'render_layer' ... on a base object of type
	# 'MeshInstance3D'" and aborts the caller; the identical script survives on the 4.8 fork, which is
	# the control arm that makes the stock result mean something. Two production paths reached here
	# unguarded — CrystalSprite3D._publish (whose docstring claimed stock "renders nothing meaningful")
	# and the additive tile overlay via Tile.gd, which gates on BLEND MODE, not on the predicate.
	#
	# The gate is here rather than at those two call sites for dec. 3's reason: two spellings of one
	# fact is how one copy became fourteen. This kernel published owns(); a decorator that throws on
	# the build state owns() exists to describe is the kernel leaking that property back to every
	# caller. Off-fork a producer draws its in-scene fallback (dec. 1) and decorates nothing.
	#

	# keeps no persistent per-member list, so a freed member just drops from next frame's rebuilt draw
	# list (EngineFoldCompositor frees enrolled carriers every frame). The real crash was a synchronous
	# free() nested in the SpinBox gui_input callstack (a tunable-write-back hazard); the fix is to defer
