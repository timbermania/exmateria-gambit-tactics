## The display-space fold's userland seed/resolve passes (ADR-0074, CONTEXT.md "Fold surface").
##
## Pure render-target plumbing that brackets the engine's held-out fold pass. Ignorant of producers
## and carriers — it only owns the two fullscreen passes. The bracket sits *before* the transparent pass
## (ADR-0080) so modern linear-alpha transparents composite over the folded PSX result:
##   Pass A (POST_OPAQUE)      seeds   = opaque scene color -> a GAME-OWNED display-space texture
##                                       (linear->display, coverage α=0), bound as the layer's
##                                       `seed_texture`; the engine copies it into the held-out
##                                       target before Pass B. Reuses foldsurface_seed.
##   Pass B (ENGINE)           folds   = the `compositor_layer` carriers, hardware add/sub/mix, drawn
##                                       over the seed into the engine-owned target (not ours). The engine
##                                       runs it between Pass A and Pass C — after the POST_OPAQUE seed,
##                                       before the PRE_TRANSPARENT resolve (Fold.FOLD_LAYER.stage=POST_OPAQUE).
##   Pass C (PRE_TRANSPARENT)  resolves = the engine-owned target (read via get_layer_texture) ->
##                                       color layer (display->linear + quantize to
##                                       `quantize_levels` + coverage
##                                       discard), reusing foldsurface_resolve. Runs before the transparent
##                                       pass, so transparents then draw over the resolved PSX layer.
##
## Migrated (wayfinder ticket 15) off the old magic-string `compositor_fold`/`color` scratch onto the
## general `compositor_layer` primitive: the held-out target is now engine-owned and keyed by the
## shared `Fold.FOLD_LAYER` resource; the seed is handed to the engine as a bound `Texture2DRD`.
##
## Split out of the old EngineFoldCompositor (which fused this scratch lifecycle with the per-frame
## carrier rebuild — two jobs that change for different reasons). EngineFoldCompositor now installs
## one of these via setup(camera) and keeps only the carrier loop.
##
## MUST run under the compositor_layer-capable engine + Forward+ (the engine Pass B + `compositor_layer`
## render_mode are Forward+-only; see RenderingServer.is_compositor_layer_supported()).

## Vault: [[Display Space Blend Fold]]

## This script, reached the way the addon reaches all its own internals after
## ADR-0212 dec. 1: by `preload` path, never by a global name.
##
## `ResolvePass._quantize_levels()` needs `quantize_levels`, and an INNER class
## cannot see the outer script's statics implicitly — it used to spell that
## `FoldSurface.quantize_levels`, through the `class_name` this addon no longer
## declares. PROBED under the 4.8 fork rather than reasoned: a self-`preload`
## binds, carries no cycle through `ExMateriaRender` (which preloads this file),
## and the read stays LIVE — mutating `quantize_levels` afterwards is visible
## through it, which is exactly what `tests/FoldSurfaceTest.gd` asserts when it
## sets `7.0` and reads the pass back.

## ADR-0212 dec. 1 — `addons/exmateria_schema` used to declare six bare globals,
## every one of them generic English (`Fold`, `DepthMode`, `ColorStack`,
## `ColorRecipe`, `CellMarking`, `TerrainCell`). It now declares only
## `ExMateriaSchema`, so these lines are what keep the use sites below spelled the
## way they were (ADR-0211 dec. 4).
const Fold = ExMateriaSchema.Fold

const _Self = preload("res://addons/exmateria_render/fold_bracket/FoldSurface.gd")

## Framebuffer quantization applied by Pass C, as **steps-1 per channel**.
##
## `31.0` is the PSX RGB555 framebuffer, and it is a **compromise, not vocabulary**
## (goal #8, ADR-0152): the PlayStation stored 5 bits per channel because of the
## hardware it had, and a consumer of this bracket may want the display-space fold
## without the 5-bit crush. Set `0.0` to resolve at full precision.
##
## It is a policy the bracket is GIVEN rather than a constant welded into its GLSL —
## which is the whole of goal #8's code half. It stays `31.0` by default because
## `Render` is the PlayStation look (ADR-0117 dec. 6, ADR-0150) and dropping it here
## is a regression, not progress. Changing it is a KNOWN DROP and owes a register
## entry at epilogue E1.

# ONE implementation, TWO adapters.
#
# Pass A and Pass C were two 90-line classes that differed in five values. Everything else — the
# `_rd / _shader / _pipeline / _fb_format / _sampler / _ready` field set, `_setup()`, `_disabled_blend()`,
# and the eight-step render callback (guard the callback type, lazy setup, fetch the
# RenderSceneBuffersRD, size check, pick source + destination, rebuild the pipeline when the
# framebuffer format moves, build the uniform set, draw three vertices with a 16-byte push constant)
# — was byte-identical, twice.
#
# So the pass is one thing and an adapter is a SPEC: which stage, which shader, what to read, what
# to write, and what quantization to send. Everything below the seam is `FullscreenPass`; everything
# genuinely per-adapter (the seed texture's lifecycle, the resolve's layer declaration) stays with
# its adapter, because it does not generalise — there is no third pass it would serve.
#
# This is an INTERNAL seam. The addon's published interface is `setup(cam)` above, and it did not move.
