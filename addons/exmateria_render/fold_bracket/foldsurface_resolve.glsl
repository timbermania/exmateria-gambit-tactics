// Fullscreen triangle (no vertex buffer). Pass C of the combat display-space
// composite (#209): resolve the DISPLAY-SPACE fold accumulator back into the LINEAR
// color layer. Runs once per frame after all mode buckets have folded into the
// scratch (pass A copy-in + pass B per-bucket blend).
//
// It resolves EVERY PIXEL. There is no coverage mark and no discard — see the block
// above main() for why the one this pass used to carry was deleted (ADR-0309).

// THERE IS NO COVERAGE MARK (ADR-0309). This pass used to ask "did a carrier draw on this
// pixel?" and `discard` when the answer was no, so the untouched 3D background kept its
// full precision. The question is deleted, not merely answered better, for three reasons —
// each measured, none of them taste:
//
// 1. THE PLAYSTATION HAD NO SUCH CARVE-OUT. Its framebuffer was 15-bit for the WHOLE
//    screen: terrain, sprites and effects alike. `Render` IS the PlayStation look
//    (ADR-0117 dec. 6, ADR-0150), so sparing the background from the crush was the
//    infidelity and the mark was preserving it. The carve-out was never an ADR decision —
//    it entered as a property of `proto_ordered_fold` ("only touch effect pixels") and
//    survived here as a comment.
//
// 2. THE MARK COULD NOT BE COMPUTED FROM WHAT THIS PASS CAN SEE. Coverage was read off the
//    accumulator's ALPHA, seeded to a 0.5 baseline because Godot's `blend_sub` drives alpha
//    DOWN (REVERSE_SUBTRACT) while add/mix drive it UP. That test is not injective: a mix
//    carrier maps a_dst -> a_src + a_dst*(1 - a_src), so a mix whose own alpha IS the
//    baseline, landing on a pixel a sub carrier already drove to 0, returns
//    0.5 + 0*(1 - 0.5) = 0.5 — the untouched value, bit for bit. Live, that pair is {76}
//    Dark Screen's half blend over a unit's subtractive ground shadow: both contributions
//    were discarded and the shadow's footprint came back as the raw undrawn scene, BRIGHTER
//    than the dim around it. No baseline fixes it (every B in [0,1) is the fixed point of
//    some mix alpha), and the carriers blend into the only channel a mark could live in.
//
// 3. RESOLVING EVERYTHING COSTS 4/255, AND IT DOES NOT BAND. Measured over a real Orbonne
//    battle frame (1024x960): 88.34% of pixels move, 79.47% of channel samples move, worst
//    4/255, mean 1.366/255. Banding was the one real objection and it does not appear —
//    along the frame's smoothest large region the mean run of one identical colour goes
//    3.90 px -> 3.91 px, against a synthetic-gradient control arm where the same
//    measurement goes 3.48 px -> 28.00 px. This frame is dithered ROM palette art; it has
//    no smooth long-range gradient for a band to form in. Distinct colours 2432 -> 809,
//    which is what a 15-bit framebuffer is.
//
// The alternative that was NOT taken is a real per-pixel mark in the STENCIL, which is
// buildable — probed on the fork, not reasoned: `stencil_mode write` works on a
// `compositor_layer` member inside the engine's held-out pass (it LOADs the shared scene
// depth), and the stencil aspect is cleared every frame, including on the branch that
// clears depth only, because a combined depth/stencil attachment takes one load op for
// both. It was refused on cost and on fidelity: 22 carrier shaders would each need a
// stencil line, 11 of them would also need an alpha `discard` they do not have today (or
// the mark would cover each effect sprite's whole QUAD, quantizing a moving rectangle of
// background — a coarser mark than the one being replaced), and reason 1 says the carve-out
// it would implement faithfully is the wrong carve-out.
