## Resolves the effect camera's base YAW so the focused unit isn't hidden.
##
## Godot heir to the ROM's `calc_facing_angles` (0x801aac28). See
## docs/context/15-effect-orchestration.md ([Cinematic facing resolution]) and ADR-0039. Layered rule:
##
##   1. Candidates: the 4 fixed yaws — the snapped base yaw plus +90 / -90 / 180
##      (PSX 0x400 = 90 deg). Pitch and zoom are NOT touched (the effect owns
##      them); only yaw is chosen.
##   2. Terrain-visibility GATE (the one behaviour the ROM models): a yaw is
##      eligible only if the focused unit's silhouette is not hidden behind map
##      geometry from that angle.
##   3. Foreground-composition TIE-BREAK (our addition): among eligible yaws,
##      fewest other UNITS occluding the silhouette (mask 4), then the yaw that
##      puts the unit most in the foreground relative to its neighbours, then
##      the ROM's minimal-rotation-from-current order (encoded by candidate
##      order + strict-improvement replacement).
##   4. All-blocked fallback (ROM-faithful): if NO yaw clears the terrain gate,
##      keep the current/base yaw.
##
## TERRAIN gate uses an ANALYTIC height march, NOT a physics raycast: the map's
## only terrain colliders are the flat tile-top convex quads (`DynamicTerrain‌-
## Builder._create_collision_shape`); the vertical cliff faces that actually
## block a low-angle view have NO collider, so a camera ray threads between the
## flat quads and never reports occlusion. Instead we step along the sightline
## and compare each column's tile-top world-Y against the ray height — the same
## thing the ROM precomputed into per-tile bits. UNIT occlusion (the tie-break)
## DOES use physics rays: units are Area3D boxes with real volume.
##
## Camera is orthographic, so occlusion depends only on the view DIRECTION — we
## probe from the subject backward along the camera-forward axis.

## ADR-0212 dec. 1 — `addons/exmateria_platform` publishes one global,
## `ExMateriaPlatform`; aliasing a member back keeps every use site below
## spelled the way it was (ADR-0211 dec. 4). The PSX trio arrived at
## extraction #7 (#1220) and lost its three bare `class_name`s on the way.
const PsxChirality = ExMateriaPlatform.PsxChirality


# ADR-0211 dec. 4 — the addon's façade is its whole symbol surface. One alias
# line per file keeps every use site's spelling, and makes a grep for
# `ExMateriaBattlefield` a complete census of host->addon symbol coupling.
const Lattice = ExMateriaBattlefield.Lattice


# This file used to hold a local `PSXConvert` constant that preloaded the old
# `src/effects/PSXCameraConvert.gd` address — a SECOND spelling for the same script, by
# path. The sign axis now lives at `ExMateriaPlatform.PsxChirality` and is aliased above
# (#1220); the local alias went with it, because an addon member reachable two ways is how
# a path reference into an addon survives a rename meant to be total (ADR-0212 dec. 4).
#
# 🔴 THE FIRST DRAFT OF THIS PARAGRAPH QUOTED THE DELETED LINE VERBATIM, AND ARM 6 COUNTED
# IT. `membership_arms.py`'s shape scan reads a preload-of-a-path wherever the form appears,
# comment or not, so arm 6 went 2 -> 3 and the third line was this note describing its own
# removal. The arm is right to be literal — a commented-out reach is still a reader's map to
# a dead address — so this is prose, and arm 6 reads 2 again: the two `TRAP1` content-pack
# lines in `TrapEffect.gd`, which ADR-0142 makes permanent rather than payable.
