## Runtime processor for palette-subsystem keyframes (map and unit tinting) — the
## combat-effect driver of the ADR-0067 unified colour stack (issue #164). A
## three-**channel** [ColorSubsystem]:
##   - affected_units: map tint      → TintedSurfaces (the reserved SURFACE_MAP token)
##   - caster:         caster unit   → TintedSurfaces
##   - target:         target unit   → TintedSurfaces
##
## Each channel's keyframes are reduced to a per-channel [ColorStack] by
## [method build_stack], then delivered by [method _deliver_output] so combat
## effects fold through `color_apply` over the real ALBEDO/CLUT entry — the
## faithful PALETTE applier (`color_tint_blend_apply @0x8008f710`, 5-bit CLUT,
## `quantize=true`, absolute base). This REPLACED the old imperative delta-domain
## stepper: the model, the 11 PSX blend modes, the DDA ramp, and the restore are all
## owned by ColorRecipe/ColorStack (proven byte-exact), so this subtype only maps
## parsed keyframes onto the stack. The declarative stack is re-derived every frame,
## so any `now` is directly evaluable (park / rewind come for free).

# ADR-0211 dec. 4 — the addon's façade is its whole symbol surface. One alias
# line per file keeps every use site's spelling, and makes a grep for
# `ExMateriaBattlefield` a complete census of host->addon symbol coupling.


const ColorStackClass = ExMateriaSchema.ColorStack
# 🟢 THE ILLUMINATION MACHINERY IS GONE (#1192, 2026-09-12). `build_illumination`,
# `_push_illum_phase_ops` and the `MapIlluminationDDA` alias are deleted. They were the
# producer half of Holy/E015's 8-bit additive map flood, unwired at rev 5 because the
# additive only ever tinted the PSX's untextured flat-colour terrain class and Godot
# renders textured terrain — so it computed to neutral 0 on every map.
#
# ADR-0208 dec. 5 declined this once, rightly: *"a counter is a weak reason."* What
# closed it was not a counter. #1192 asked for the run its own caveat said was missing,
# and got it — a probe in `build_illumination` fired 2x in its own unit test (the positive
# control, without which a zero means nothing) and 0x across eight battle and
# effect-playback scenes. On that evidence the owner ruled the future untextured-terrain
# scope dead, and ADR-0287 dec. 5's rule applies: an extraction must not carry dead code
# into an addon *"where a later reader will find it inside a published package and assume
# it is part of the interface."*
#
# THE DELIVERY HALF WENT WITH IT — `TintedSurfaces.update_illumination` and its
# `map_illum_add` sink. They were one feature in two files and #1224 had carried the
# second over on the same retention note; deleting one and keeping the other would have
# left a sink nothing feeds.
#
# ⚠️ WHAT STAYS, and it is deliberately not this addon's call:
# `addons/exmateria_battlefield/texturing/MapIlluminationDDA.gd` and the `map_illum_add`
# uniform in `indexed_color.gdshader` are `Battlefield`'s, still covered by
# `MapIlluminationDDATest`, and #1192 scopes them out. They are now independently
# unreached — a fact for that package to price, not for this one to act on.

# NAMED, NOT PRELOADED (ADR-0208 dec. 2 + dec. 5) — HISTORY NOW, kept because the warning
# below still binds. The alias this described (`MapIlluminationDDA`) was deleted at #1192;
# before that it had already been walked back from a `preload` of the addon script by full
# path, which was the last criterion-4 path reach from `src/`, the shipped game.
#
# ⚠️ DO NOT SPELL THE OLD PATH HERE, not even in prose. `check_lattice_scene.py` does not
# strip comments (its sibling `check_lattice_publish.py` does, via `_code_lines`), so a
# comment quoting the `res://addons/...` literal re-creates the very row this line paid —
# observed while writing this block, and recorded as ADR-0208 dec. 7.

## Build the per-channel [ColorStack] for a phase from the parsed keyframes — the

## it over the real ALBEDO base. Consumer profile: this is the PALETTE applier
## (`color_tint_blend_apply @0x8008f710`) — 5-bit CLUT, so `quantize=true`, params

## frame offsets (`phase_starts[phase]`) and folding at the absolute effect frame keeps
## phase1's settled tint present when for_each's ops fade in on top — no per-phase
## rebuild, so no pop at the boundary (the map color-parity fix, Raise/E005). A phase
## absent from `phase_starts` (not yet started) contributes nothing — and a future
