## Live "engine-fold" combat compositor — the NEW pipeline (Godot 4.8-dev, Forward+ only).
##
## Where the retired raw-GLSL fold (CombatDisplaySpaceComposite, deleted in #228 Phase 3) re-implemented
## each prim's shading in GLSL, this drives the effect prims through the ENGINE's Pass B fold: each
## OTDepthPrimOrder run is materialized as a per-run MultiMeshInstance3D wearing the REAL particle
## gdshader flagged `compositor_layer`, made a member via render_layer + stamped render_layer_order =
## its fold-order key. The engine draws them (in render_layer_order order, not depth) into the
## engine-owned held-out target for that layer, which:
##   Pass A (FoldSurface, POST_OPAQUE)      seeds  = opaque scene color → display
##   Pass B (ENGINE)                        folds  = the flagged prims, hardware add/sub/mix
##   Pass C (FoldSurface, PRE_TRANSPARENT)  resolves = display → linear + RGB555, EVERY pixel
##
## Passes A/C (the scratch lifecycle) are owned by FoldSurface — a separate module, since the scratch
## plumbing and the per-frame carrier rebuild change for different reasons (ADR-0074). This file owns
## ONLY the carrier rebuild: read the pool, materialize per-run MultiMeshInstance3D carriers, stamp
## their fold order. setup(camera) installs a FoldSurface and starts the carrier loop.
##
## Attach with `setup(camera)`; it reads EffectMultiMeshPool each frame (the per-frame carrier
## rebuild the retired CombatCompositeDriver used to do — #228 Phase 3). See memory
## engine-shaded-fold-passB-demi2-stage1 / engine-fold-scoped-demi-harness-plan.
##
## OCCLUSION (resolved 2026-07-27): the fold materials are `depth_draw_never` + depth-test ENABLED.
## The engine's fold pass builds its framebuffer from the compositor scratch + the SHARED opaque scene
## depth (render_forward_clustered.cpp: `rb->get_depth_texture()`, LOADed not cleared) and tests DEPTH
## with GREATER_OR_EQUAL. The fold shaders write `DEPTH = ot_computed_depth` — the same reversed-Z
## NDC the opaque scene writes — so folded effects (particles AND callbacks) are occluded per-fragment
## by units/map at their true depth. `depth_draw_never` keeps the fold from writing depth, so effects
## still fold against EACH OTHER in `render_layer_order` (OTDepthPrimOrder), not camera depth.
##
## MUST run under the 4.8-dev engine + `--rendering-method forward_plus` (the `compositor_layer`
## render_mode and the engine held-out pass are Forward+-only).

## Vault: [[Display Space Blend Fold]]

## The fold bracket, aliased back to its bare spelling through the addon's one
## global name (ADR-0212 dec. 1, ADR-0211 dec. 4). `addons/exmateria_render`
## used to declare `class_name FoldSurface`; it now declares only
## `ExMateriaRender`, so this line is what keeps every use site below spelled
## the way it was.
const FoldSurface = ExMateriaRender.FoldSurface

## And the same for `addons/exmateria_schema`, whose six generic-English globals
## collapsed onto one façade in the same pass (ADR-0212 dec. 1).
const DepthMode = ExMateriaSchema.DepthMode
const Fold = ExMateriaSchema.Fold

## Preloaded `Shader` objects, not `String` paths — ADR-0191 dec. 11. A `load()` on a
## mistyped path returns null, a null shader does not raise, and the fold "just stops, with no
## error". That hazard is a property of naming a fold shader from GDScript, not of picking
## between two, so it reaches this block even though dec. 2's rule does not.

# native_blend = true (the Effect Studio toggle). Opt-in — default false leaves the production fold path
# byte-for-byte unchanged.
# Preloaded with their fold twins above: not fold shaders themselves (no `compositor_layer`), but

# Pool-envelope → display-gouraud gain (the retired `psx_brightness` global, ADR-0074 endgame).
# The effect POOL decodes its colour curve to `/255` (EffectData: byte/255), so `color_modulate`
# does NOT span the full PSX gouraud range — it is the pool's `/127`-ish ENVELOPE. This scalar is
# the `÷255→÷128` scale-conversion that lifts it to display-space gouraud. It USED to live in the
# fold fragment as `* psx_brightness` (a GLOBAL uniform that also bit the opaque/in-scene paths and
# was a tuning footgun); the endgame bakes it into the fold COLOR here — the single choke point
# where every add/sub/mix run's COLOR is finalized for ALL pooled producers (particles + trap) —
# so `psx_brightness` can be deleted and every fold is uniformly `texel × gouraud/128`. Value is the
# exact retired 2.2 (DEMI2 fold-color audit verdict: FAITHFUL — do NOT "fix" to a literal /128, that
# would change appearance; this is a net-neutral relocation). See check_no_psx_brightness_in_fold.py.
