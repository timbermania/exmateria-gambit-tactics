## ExMateriaEffectSfx (Autoload Singleton) — the single, always-running FFT effect
## SFX driver. Accessed globally as: ExMateriaEffectSfx.
##
## Models the PSX SPU faithfully: a fixed-clock SPU that never stops. The pool +
## sequencer runtime are built once and tick every frame forever; keyed-off
## voices release and the reverb tank decays on that clock whether or not any
## effect is feeding new notes — so tails are never trimmed.
##
## Voice budget (two modes — FAITHFUL keeps PSX parity, the toggle preserves it):
##   FAITHFUL — exact FFT effect pool on one SPU: 8 slots, voices 16-23, slots
##              6-7 reserved -> 3 concurrent stereo pairs. For parity/A-B.
##   UNLOCKED — each SPU uses all 24 voices (base 0) -> 12 pairs, AND the engine
##              spins up additional stacked SPU "units" on demand (up to
##              MAX_UNITS) so many simultaneous effects don't starve. Idle units
##              aren't rendered, so cost scales with concurrent activity, not the
##              cap. This is the game default.
##
## A "unit" = one Spu + its own pool/flush/walker/runtime AND its own entity
## list (so each unit's Runtime drives only its own casts — see the per-unit
## entity-list injection in runtime.gd / play_sound.gd) AND its own reverb tank.
## Each effect cast binds to one unit at its first dispatch, ONE CAST PER UNIT:
## routed to an empty unit (or a freshly spawned one), doubling up only at the
## MAX_UNITS cap. This keeps concurrent casts on separate SPUs so they sum at the
## downstream bus limiter (smooth) instead of summing + brick-wall-clipping
## inside one unit's C++ core, and gives each cast an uncoupled reverb tail.
##
## Music coexists on the separate ExMateriaAudioEngine.music_spu; SFX units never touch
## it. Every SFX caller (game effects AND the FEDS/SFX-bank audition scenes)
## goes through this one engine, so all scenes behave identically.
##
## Must autoload AFTER ExMateriaAudioEngine (uses ExMateriaAudioEngine.sfx_spu + waveset).

## The Godot bus this engine's stream lands on — `Master <- {Music, SFX, Ambient}`
## (D3 decision 6, #376 / #385 task 2). Effect SFX gets its own fader, separate from the
## score on `Music`; both used to hardcode `"Master"`, so a consumer had one knob for
## everything. Unknown-bus-safe and effect-free for the same reasons as
## `SMDPlayer.OUTPUT_BUS` — see the note there.
const OUTPUT_BUS := &"SFX"
## Ambient beds play on their OWN bus. That bus split is what now buys the
## headroom decoupling `_bg_limiter` used to buy by running a second hand-rolled
## limiter over the same summed buffer — a loud bed and combat SFX reach Master
## through independent limiters instead of sharing one gain (#385 task 3, §3a).
const BG_OUTPUT_BUS := &"Ambient"
## How far ahead of the audio clock the scheduler stamps register writes.
##
## For MUSIC a long lead is free — SMDPlayer runs 2 s, because a song has no
## responsiveness requirement. SFX is the opposite: a cue stamped at frame F
## SOUNDS at frame F, so the lead IS the input latency, and `D3` dec. 7 caps it
## at one mix block (11.6 ms) + output latency (measured 33-44 ms on this
## machine) — a budget of roughly 45-55 ms, not 11.6.
##
## The lead must EXCEED one mix block, and that is the binding constraint. At 3
## subs (~12.5 ms) against 11.6 ms blocks there is under 1 ms of margin, and the
## live stress rig measured ~180 overdue register writes per second: the audio
## thread reaches a frame before the scheduler has stamped it. Six subs (~25 ms)
## leaves ~13 ms of margin, holds `late` at 0, and still sits comfortably inside
## `D3` dec. 7's budget. The scheduler stamps whole subs, so the real lead rides
## between ~25 and ~29 ms.
##
## This is also why the scheduler keeps its own thread rather than folding into
## `_process` the way the music player did. GPUArena runs at 15 fps — a 66 ms
## frame, longer than the whole budget — so a main-thread scheduler would stamp
## most cues after the audio clock had already passed them.

const UNIT_IDLE_TAIL_SUBS := 720
# Defensive-reap grace (~240 subs/sec). A dispatched cast whose sequence is done,
# whose unit has no active voices, and that has been idle this long is treated as
# abandoned (caller missed its orphan/end) and reclaimed so it can't wedge a unit
# — see _reap_dead_sessions. 2 s is comfortably longer than the gap between a
# cast's pairs, so it won't cut a still-sequencing multi-pair effect.
const REAP_GRACE_SUBS := 480
# Defensive-reap grace for a ONE-SHOT cast (play_one_shot): one that has told the
# engine it will dispatch exactly one pair and will never be ended. The long grace
# above exists to protect a multi-pair effect mid-sequence, which a one-shot cannot
# be, so all this has to cover is the scheduler's own lead — the sequencer runs
# SCHED_LEAD_SUBS ahead of the audio clock, so "sequencing done" is true up to that
# far before the sound has actually been heard. 24 subs (100 ms) is 4x that lead and
# still 20x shorter than REAP_GRACE_SUBS. The reap's other two conditions (no active
# voices on the unit, sequence finished) are what actually decide; this only keeps a
# just-dispatched cast from being examined inside the lead window.
const ONE_SHOT_REAP_GRACE_SUBS := 24
# W11/R28 — the SILENCE fallback that lets a ONE-SHOT cast be reaped even while its
# unit still reports voices. The reap's "still audible" condition asks
# _unit_voice_count(u), which is a per-UNIT question: all one-shot casts pack onto
# MAX_EVENT_UNITS=2 reserved cores, so in sustained combat one audible blip vetoes
# reaping every other session on that core, forever. Measured at 80 units: 99.5 % of
# all reap skips, `killed` = 0 after the first window, and 240 drained sessions still
# linked into their core's entity list and sequenced every sub at ~32 us each — which
# put the scheduler over its 4.16 ms/sub budget and made a main-thread cue wait 25.7 ms
# on _audio_mutex (R28, F39-F42).
#
# Why a TIME fallback rather than a per-session voice test: the honest per-session
# question needs a per-voice audibility signal the SPU does not publish
# (get_audio_active_voices() is a unit-wide count; get_voice_debug_info() builds a
# 30-key Dictionary off core_ and carries the cross-thread read hazard the streamed
# count exists to avoid). And the per-unit veto is not merely conservative — it is what
# makes release_and_free() safe, because that keys off every slot in the play's
# _dispatchers array and a preempted slot's entry goes stale. So this does not remove
# the veto; it adds a second way past it that is strictly narrower:
#   - ONE-SHOT casts only (the reserved event lane). Combat casts, beds and the click
#     unit keep the veto unconditionally.
#   - `is_sequencing_done()` still gates it, so a cast whose slot was stolen by a live
#     cast reads NOT done (that slot's active_word bit-0 is set) and stays.
#   - 120 subs = 500 ms of silence AFTER the sequence ended. A one-shot blip's release
#     tail is far shorter, so its own voices are provably stopped; the residual is a
#     spurious key-off on a slot stolen by a cast that has ALSO already drained.
# Same family as ONE_SHOT_REAP_GRACE_SUBS above, and for the same reason: the
# lifecycle a fire-and-forget cast actually has is not the one the long grace assumes.
const ONE_SHOT_SILENCE_SUBS := 120
# UNLOCKED hard cap on stacked SPUs. With one-cast-per-unit routing this is also
# the max number of SIMULTANEOUS casts before they double up — 8 covers any
# realistic tactics-battle overlap. Each rendered unit adds one reverb tank's
# per-sample cost, and idle units sleep, so cost tracks concurrent activity and
# the cap only bounds the worst case.
const MAX_UNITS := 8
# Safety cap for an orphaned cast (visual ended) whose sound never reaches
# EndBar (e.g. a looping ambient) — force it to release after ~15 s so it can't
# drone/leak forever. Normal effects reap as soon as their FEDS sequence ends.
const ORPHAN_MAX_SUBS := 3600
# Reserved ambient ({6B} BG Sound) SPU units, held OUTSIDE the MAX_UNITS transient
# pool. A persistent looping bed (rain/windmill) would otherwise permanently hold a
# transient unit and, at the cap, get combat hits doubled onto its core (in-core
# clip). These reserved units are never returned by _pick_unit, never count against
# the 8-unit combat budget, and feed their OWN bus limiter so a loud bed can't eat
# combat's headroom. Small fixed set — scenario 4 layers 2 beds (rain + windmill);
# a couple more give headroom. Spawned lazily like transient units (idle ones sleep).
const MAX_BG_UNITS := 4
# Reserved GAME-EVENT ({21} sound effects, UI cues, unit-death blips — everything
# SfxRouter routes through play_one_shot) SPU units, held OUTSIDE the MAX_UNITS
# transient pool.
#
# These casts do NOT want _pick_unit's one-cast-per-unit policy. That policy buys a
# combat effect its own reverb tank so concurrent casts mix at the bus instead of
# summing in one core — worth a whole SPU for a big multi-pair effect. A game-event
# blip is a SINGLE pair (two voices) of a 12-pair pool, and the PSX gave the whole
# game one SPU; spending one of eight combat units on each blip is what let a
# repeated cue take the pool to the cap. Measured in GPUArena: at 8 live units the
# scheduler's per-sub stamping runs over its 4.16 ms real-time budget and the audio
# clock drops to ~130 subs/s against a required 240 — i.e. the SFX and the music
# both slow down. Capping this lane at two units bounds that by construction.
#
# Two units x EVENT_SESSIONS_PER_UNIT is far more concurrent game-event sound than
# anything reachable: the loudest real burst is a wipe (a handful of unit_died) or a
# key-repeat-driven UI cue, and one unit alone holds 12 pairs.

## to parse in any project but the host's:
##
##     godot --path exmateria-sound --check-only -s res://addons/exmateria_sound/runtime/effect_sfx_engine.gd
##     Parse Error: Identifier "ExMateriaAudioEngine" not declared in the current scope.  x13
##
## The pair is real and stays — this engine genuinely needs the shared waveset and the
## boot-loaded SFX SPU, and the autoload ORDER note above is still the contract. What
## changes is only how the name is resolved: a `/root/` lookup names no symbol, so the
## file parses everywhere and a consumer that did not autoload the pair gets a null and
## a push_error naming the reason, instead of a parse error naming an identifier.
##
## Deliberately UNTYPED — a `Node`-typed local cannot reach `ready_ok`/`waveset`/`sfx_spu`
## without the static type this exists to avoid needing.

## races the producer thread (both must serialize on _audio_mutex), and (b) unit 0
## idles out of _unit_active when it has no session, so the producer stops ticking
## the SPU and the preview is silent after the first play. This routes the poke
## through a RESERVED unit kept force-active while sounding, under the mutex.

## Hold-to-play a single note: key it on and hold until audition_note_off(). Real
## pitch/adsr from the caller (the studio resolves them from the waveset instrument).
## tail<0 → a normal key_on (attack + sustain, hear the loop by holding); tail>=0 →

## pure ring, skipping the attack). Voices rotate so a fast re-press hits a fresh one.

	## clock — see _behind_locked.
	##
	## FAIRNESS IS THE SHAPE OF THIS LOOP. Every iteration takes the mutex ONCE,
	## stamps at most SCHED_CATCHUP_MAX_SUBS subs, releases, and then ALWAYS
	## yields before trying again. The unconditional yield is the point, not an
	## idle optimisation: this loop used to re-acquire immediately whenever it was
	## `behind`, and a thread that unlocks and instantly re-locks beats a waiter
	## the kernel has only just woken. glibc mutexes are not FIFO, so that is a
	## barge and it can repeat indefinitely. Measured in GPUArena under a burst of
	## game-event SFX, a main-thread SfxRouter cast waited 3591 ms on
	## _audio_mutex.lock() inside one continuous `behind` streak, and the frame
	## went with it. Releasing and yielding bounds that wait at about one batch
	## plus one yield.
	##
	## The two knobs trade against each other and both matter:
	##  - SCHED_CATCHUP_MAX_SUBS caps how long ONE hold can be. Raising it is
	##    directly a worse worst-case wait for the main thread — at 8 subs and a
	##    full transient pool the hold measured ~57 ms.
	##  - the yield is SCHED_YIELD_USEC (not SCHED_IDLE_MS) whenever this wake
	##    actually stamped, because a full millisecond per sub would cap catch-up
	##    near 1000 subs/s against a 240/s requirement — enough to hold the lead,
	##    with no margin to refill it after a hitch. When the lead is already full
	##    there is nothing to be prompt about, so it sleeps SCHED_IDLE_MS.
	##
	## None of this makes the loop affordable at any unit count: stamping cost
	## scales with the number of ACTIVE units, and past roughly half the transient
	## pool it exceeds its 4.16 ms per-sub real-time budget however fairly it is
	## scheduled. Keeping the unit count down is the reserved lanes' job
	## (_pick_event_unit, _pick_bg_unit, _ensure_click_unit), not this loop's.
