	## Dynamics — opcode 0xE0 smd_dynamics at PC 0x80016614. Three writes:
	##   1. chan+0x98 := byte << 24    (PC 0x80016620, sw — expression
	##                                  accumulator initial value)
	##   2. chan+0x6 &= 0xfff7         (PC 0x8001662c — clears bit 0x8,
	##                                  disarming any in-flight 0xE2 burst)
	##   3. chan+0x2 |= 0x100          (PC 0x80016634 — vol prestage)
	## The drainer at FUN_80017118 reads `lh v1, 0x98(s0)` with s0 =
	## chan_base + 0x2, so it reads chan_base+0x9A = HIGH halfword of
	## chan+0x98 (= byte<<8 effectively). The 0xE2 expression burst then
	## ramps chan+0x98 in 32-bit space at PC 0x800151FC.
	# NB on LFO callback: an earlier comment here claimed
	# smd_dynamics writes LAB_800176E4 to slot+0x100 at PC 0x80016728,
	# disarming the swap probe. That PC is actually inside FUN_800166C8
	# (= opcode 0xE4 at jumptable 0x80028C9C), not smd_dynamics. FFT's
	# 0xE0 body is bounded by PC 0x80016614..0x80016638 and never
	# touches chan+0xE0 or chan+0x100. The previous
	# `channel.lfo_swap_probe_active = false` line here used to disarm
	# the probe on every E0 dispatch — incorrectly tying the probe gate
	# to a write that 0xE0 doesn't perform. Removed; the swap probe is
	# now armed/disarmed only by D9 (and E5, when sub-slot 1 modeling
	# is added) based on the actual wf_idx selected.
	# All three writes below are channel-side state per the dispatcher
	# contract (line 159-167): chan_word_1 bit, expression_acc_s32
	# (= FFT chan+0x98), vol_burst_active (= FFT chan+0x6 bit 0x8).
	# FFT's smd_dynamics writes these unconditionally per-channel — no
	# voice/silent gate. Gating on voice_writes here used to drop the
	# expression_acc seed on silent-driver channels; the next E2 on
	# that channel then saw expression_acc_s32 == 0, computed delta
	# == 0, and early-returned without arming vol_burst. Cure_4's
	# slot 4 (silent driver) received E0 #3 at cad 0 + E2 #4 at cad
	# 251 — Godot dropped the burst, costing 115 expression_ramp
	# fires and ~115 vol_inputs fires (diagnosed via
	# diag_vol_burst_transition, see VOL_FORMULA_GATE_DEFICIT.md).
