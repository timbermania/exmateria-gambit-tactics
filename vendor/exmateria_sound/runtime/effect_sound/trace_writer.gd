extends RefCounted
## Probe trace writer for the effect-sound parity loop.
##
## The orchestrator at exmateria-sound/workspace/orchestrator/ runs PCSX-side
## probes that write JSONL rows for each of the 8 GOLD probe sites. This
## class emits the matching Godot-side rows to a single combined JSONL file;
## exmateria-sound/workspace/orchestrator/validate_probe_pair.py filters by
## the row's `kind` field to compare per-probe.
##
## Activated by render_feds_pair.gd's `--trace-effect-sound=<dir>` flag. When
## disabled, every emit() is a fast no-op so the dispatcher can leave its
## emit calls in place without conditional gating at every site.
##
## NOTE: deliberately uses `extends RefCounted` without `class_name`. The
## emit sites preload this script (`const _Trace = preload(...)`); the
## script Resource itself is the type the callers see. Avoiding `class_name`
## means the singleton works even when the project's class cache is stale or
## absent (which is the common state under `godot --script ... --headless`
## or just-cloned worktrees), and there's no self-reference parse cycle.

# Clock 1 anchor: cadence pulse index. Incremented by play_sound.gd at the
# start of each tick_all_dispatchers call (= one RCnt2 IRQ fire on the FFT
# side). emit() auto-injects this into every row so Clock 2 events
# (opcode dispatches, note handler, etc.) carry the cadence pulse they
# fired in. PCSX-side global CADENCE_INDEX in _probe_common.lua mirrors
# this exactly; matching values prove Clock 1 ↔ Clock 2 phase alignment.

# Flips true on the first event_dispatch fire (set by SharedDispatcher).
# Layer-5 probes that fire pre-anchor (spu_irq_walker passes, LFO state
# init, etc.) gate their emits on this so PCSX's post-anchor-only row
# count is matched exactly. The SPU register writes / state updates
# themselves are NOT gated — only the trace emits.

# Flips true one tick AFTER _first_dispatch_fired — set by play_sound.gd's
# end-of-tick anchor latch. Use this (not _first_dispatch_fired) to gate
# probes that fire from walker passes INSIDE the anchor tick: by the time
# `_post_anchor` is true, the cadence has truly transitioned to post-
# anchor numbering (cad=1 on the next tick). Symmetric with PCSX gating
# on `FIRST_OPCODE_FIRED && CADENCE_INDEX > 0`.
