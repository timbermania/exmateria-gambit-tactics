## play_sound + feds_channel_resolver bridge — port of FUN_800125A8 +
## FUN_80013B20.
##
## In FFT, play_sound(sound_id) routes to feds_channel_resolver, which:
##   1. Looks up the resource node via (a1 >> 16) — the feds resource_id.
##   2. Reads `feds + 0x14 + config*4` to get an `entry_val` that encodes
##      the per-config slot_idx.
##   3. Allocates a pair starting at slot_idx (free-list walk).
##   4. Initializes both slots' channel-state words and binds opcode streams.
##
## The exact entry_val → slot_idx derivation is not yet fully traced.
## For first-pass cure_single we accept slot_idx as a caller-supplied
## parameter; once the formula is resolved this becomes self-deriving.
