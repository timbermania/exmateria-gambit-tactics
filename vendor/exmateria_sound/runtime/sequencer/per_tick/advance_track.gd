# Mirror of FFT post-walker look-ahead at PC 0x80015534-94. FFT peeks the
# IMMEDIATELY-NEXT byte (chan+0x16 stream pointer + 0). If that byte is a
# Note (< 0x80) → SET CHAN0_LAST_NOTE_FLAG (bit 0x1000). If it's an opcode
# byte (>= 0x80) → CLEAR. The previous Godot logic peeked ts.events[event_idx]
# AFTER the post-note scan consumed Rests/Fermatas/opcodes, which makes
# Godot see the NEXT NoteEvent past those skips and SET the bit, while FFT
# (peeking one byte) sees an opcode and CLEARS. That divergence shows up on
# probe_per_channel_tick_entry chan_word_0 (e.g. track 1 cad 3: PCSX 0x0181
# vs Godot 0x1181 pre-fix). MUSIC_OPEN_BUGS_DEEP_REFACTOR_PLAN.md §6.
#
# MUSIC_ITER58: extended to traverse Repeat/Coda. The doc-described
# clearing set is {0x80 Rest, 0x81 Fermata, 0x90 EndBar w/o loop, 0xB0/B1
# Slur}. Other opcodes (0x99 Coda, 0x9A RepeatBreak, and anything else)
# advance past. Without the 0x99 Coda follow, MUSIC_86 (71 Repeat/Coda
# pairs) drops CHAN0_LAST_NOTE_FLAG inside loop bodies whenever a Note
# is followed by a Coda byte, even though the loop body restarts with a
# Note — which kills the dispatcher.gd:307 end-of-note ADSR2-LOW=6
# force-release gate and leaves the SPU release rate at the instrument's
# slow value (rms_ratio = 1.42 on MUSIC_86 pre-fix).
