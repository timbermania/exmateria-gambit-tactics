	#                           bits into a sequencer-global word)

	# touching anything.
	# ch+0x2d is only written during channel-init paths; in MUSIC_34
	# both 0xD2 dispatches land on channels where ch+0x2d bit 0 is
	# clear (probe would see no audio effect). ch+0x34 and seq+0x68
	# readers live outside the sound-driver range; tracing their
	# audio effect is a separate iter.
	# Arg count 1 per FFT opcode-size table @ 0x80028d5e (encoded 0x02
	# = args+1); the handler doesn't READ the byte — dispatcher
	# advances the stream pointer before entering.
