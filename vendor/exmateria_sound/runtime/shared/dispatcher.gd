## Per-channel feds opcode dispatcher — port of FUN_80015324.
##
## Each pool slot owns one feds file_channel. Per tick, the dispatcher:
##   1. Decrements note_duration. When it reaches 0, sets channel_word_0
##      bit 0x400 (KON_ARM) — the duration-expire path that arms the
##      next Note for a primary KON.
##   2. Snapshots channel_word_0 → s2; clears bits 0x100/0x200/0x400 from
##      the live word_0 (L9472–9477).
##   3. Walks opcode bytes until a delta-time consumes the rest of the tick.
##      Each opcode handler sets flag bits + per-channel state.
##
## After the dispatcher returns, the slot's flag_word drives the per-tick
## flush which stages SPU writes.
##
## Walker re-arm convention (DO NOT add walker_flag_word arms in opcode
## handlers below). Per FFT semantics, opcode dispatch sets the per-tick
## flag (slot+0x4 / `flag_word` here); the per-tick handler (FUN_80017118
## / flush_tick.gd) is what re-arms the walker flag (sub_slot+0x2 /
## `walker_flag_word`) at the timeline rate. Adding walker re-arms at
## opcode time would cause same-tick double-write relative to the per-tick
## path.
