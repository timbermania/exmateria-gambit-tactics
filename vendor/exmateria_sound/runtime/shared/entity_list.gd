## Shared sound-entity LIFO. Port of FFT's DAT_80032A50 linked-list head.
##
## FFT analog:
##   DAT_80032A50               — global ptr, head of the LIFO
##   FUN_80014024 entity_ll_push(e)    — *e = head; head = e; (LIFO insert)
##   FUN_80014078 entity_ll_unlink(e)  — walk head→tail, splice out
##
## The same list holds music entities (one per loaded .SMD) AND effect-sound
## entities (one per active effect slot). FFT's spu_updater_tick walks
## DAT_80032A50 for the per-IRQ outer loop at PC 0x80014BCC; it dispatches
## the per-channel chain (per-tick handler / opcode interpreter / LFO / SPU
## flush) regardless of music-vs-SFX origin.
##
## In Godot we'd lose the in-band pointer convention (Godot uses Object refs,
## not raw struct pointers), so the LIFO is implemented as a typed Array.
## Pushing prepends; walk() iterates head→tail; unlink() is O(N) linear-
## scan + erase. Expected list size is small (max ~32: 1 music entity + 8
## SFX entities + a handful of silent-driver entities).
##
## Consumers (Pass 6+):
##   - MusicEntityState   — pushed by Sequencer.load_trackset; unlinked by stop.
##   - EffectSoundPool    — wired in Pass 8 to push each EffectEntityCatchupState.
##   - per-IRQ walker     — wired in Pass 8; iterates walk() instead of
##                          EffectSoundPool._slots and Sequencer.tracks
##                          separately.
##
## Until Pass 8 wires consumers the LIFO is a self-contained shape;
## `_smoke_self_test()` exercises push / walk / unlink semantics so the
## abstraction is verifiable on its own.

var _entries: Array = []

# Pass 8 phase 1 — class-level singleton accessor. Music's Sequencer
# pushes its music_entity here at load_smd; SFX's EffectPlaySound
# will push its EffectEntityCatchupState in a follow-up phase. Until
# Pass 8 phase 3 wires the unified driver loop, no consumer walks the
# list — this is foundation plumbing only.
#
# Untyped to avoid the self-class-reference compile error GDScript
# trips on when a class names itself inside its own body. The
# Sequencer-side preload (const _SharedEntityList = preload(...))
# binds the type for callers.
