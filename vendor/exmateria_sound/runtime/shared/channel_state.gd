## Per-channel bytecode-runner state — corresponds to one FFT feds channel
## struct (each ~0x160 bytes per stride observation).
##
## Mirrors the FFT architecture where a CHANNEL holds bytecode position +
## per-channel runtime state, and writes its flag bits to a separate per-
## voice slot via a `target_voice_idx` route. Multiple channels CAN share
## a target voice — the audible pair's slot_a channel and a silent driver
## pair's slot_a channel may both contribute flag bits to the same SPU
## voice. The flush layer (flush_tick.gd) then issues one set of SPU
## writes per voice, regardless of how many channels contributed.

	# [0,0,0,0] closes the 9704-row "mode" half of the subslot 1/2
	# divergence without changing audio: the sub-slot iterator at
	# advance_lfo.gd:222 already gates `if mode != 1 and mode != 2:
	# continue`, so default mode=0 → continue, the math doesn't run.
	# Same audio as default mode=1/2 with active=0 (which also skips
