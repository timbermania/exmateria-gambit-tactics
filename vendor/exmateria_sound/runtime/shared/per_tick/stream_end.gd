## FFT analog: end-of-stream KOFF logic at L8001adf0 + L800159ac
##
## When the feds opcode stream is exhausted AND there's no remaining
## note duration, fire one-shot end-of-stream housekeeping:
##   - Arm KOFF_PENDING (audible primaries only)
##   - Set FLAG_STREAM_END so flush_tick deactivates the slot
##   - Mirror EndBar's bit-clear so case-16 spurious S in flag_word
##     doesn't fire mid-stream
##   - Clear slot.active_word bit 0x1 so the walker gate disarms
