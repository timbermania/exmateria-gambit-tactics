## FFT analog: per_channel_tick pitch-stage block at PC 0x80015234+
##
## Stages walker PITCH bit + chan_word_1 PITCH_PRESTAGE based on the
## current pre-pitch accumulator and pitch_bend state. Runs every
## dispatcher.tick() after _advance_lfo. Tracks `porta_was_active`
## (pre-decrement state) so the deactivation tick still fires.
